      <h2> <span>10</span> 1993 Honda NSX-R</h2>
      <p>
        There's no getting around it, the Honda NSX was a masterpiece. And if you've ever seen the famous video of Aryton Senna himself thrashing the car around Suzuka at some blisteringly quick speeds in nothing but his causal clothes and a pair of loafers, you'll know just how brilliant the car truly is.

The NSX-R model was introduced in 1992, and was a more racey version of the standard NSX, shedding a little weight, and cranking everything up to 11. Aimed at taking down the likes of the Ferrari 348, the NSX was the first production car to feature an aluminum semi-monocoque which, combined with a 3.0-liter V6 producing 270 hp, meant that it was fast and agile. The NSX is one of the best sports cars ever built in Japan, and there are not many in the world that offer a better driving experience.

      <h2> <span>9</span> 1996 Nissan Skyline R33 GT-R LM Limited</h2>
      <p>
        Introduced in May 1996 to celebrate Nissan's participation in the 24 hours of Le Mans, the 1996 Nissan Skyline LM Limited is an incredibly rare model of the great R33 GT-R. Containing some weight shaving to make it live closer to the race car version, the LM Limited is an incredibly rare, and highly sought-after R33 today.

To be honest, pretty much all GT-Rs offer an exhilarating drive, but they'll always be something exciting about sitting in a race-tribute version of a car: the little details are what makes the LM Limited stand out, as well as the fantastic 2.6-liter twin-turbocharged RB26DETT I6. Only 188 units of the model were made, and alongside the crazy Nismo 400R, the LM Limited stands as an incredibly rare JDM icon of the '90s.

      <h2> <span>8</span> 1993 Mazda Eunos Roadster</h2>
      <p>
        The first generation Eunos roadster is the epitome of small JDM sports cars: pop-up headlights, a small but powerful engine, and a great handling setup. Because of this, the Roadster, alongside its rest-of-the-world counterpart the MX-5, is easily one of the best classic sports cars of all time, not because of its speed or power, but because of the massive smile it will put on any face.

Originally containing a nippy 120-hp 1.6-liter engine and being capable of 60 mph in about 9 seconds, the Roadster was a well-balanced machine, and one capable of some fairly impressive track and autocross times. But that wasn't really what the Roadster was about, it's a classic sports car wrapped into an everyday experience, allowing for fun without comprising on practicality. The Roadster is no Ferrari killer, but it was never meant to be.

        1998 Subaru Impreza 22B STi</h2>
      <p>
        Subaru is a household name for any rally fan or JDM car enthusiast, and the Impreza 22B STi may have been their pièce de résistance. Made to honor both the company's 40th anniversary and the team's 3rd WRC constructors' championship, the 22B was a very limited-run model, selling out pretty much instantly on its release in 1998.

The car was based on the GC8E WRX STi, with pretty much everything thrown out and upgraded: including a Frankenstein engine that made 272hp, a set of Bilstein suspension, and a special blue paint color to represent the link to the WRC version. The 22B is an incredible car, and no matter what surface you thrash it around on, whether it be asphalt, dirt, or snow, the 22B will have an answer, it's the king of JDM rally.

      <h2> <span>6</span>
        1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R R32</h2>
      <p>
        There's not much of a debate, the Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 stands as one of if not the best JDM car in history: a perfect balance of power and agility wrapped into a brilliant all-wheel drive system. There's a reason the car earned the nickname “Godzilla” and why most fans would do anything to get their hands on one today.

After discontinuing the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989, and in doing so, sparked a chain reaction of a great car after great car for over a decade for the company. No matter which trim level of R32 you're in, the excitement and performance of the car are one of the best you can experience. There are faster, better-looking, and more powerful cars, but none quite like the R32.

      <h2> <span>5</span>
        1992 Toyota Supra Twin Turbo R</h2>
      <p>
        It might confuse a couple of you as to why on earth the third-generation Supra is on this list instead of the more well-known fourth-generation. The answer is simple, all the more powerful models of the Supra that were made were actually not available in Japan, making them non-JDM. There was a twin-turbo model sure, but it made just as much horsepower as this: the 1992 Toyota Supra Twin Turbo R, so in the spirit of change, the R makes the list.

The R was the lightest and fastest model of the third generation of Supra and came with a bunch of upgrades including lighter sway bars, a larger intercooler, Torsen differential, Interbred TEIN/Bilstein sports suspension, Shadow/Dark gray interior trim, a MOMO steering wheel and gear knob and Recaro seats and door trim. All in all, the R was capable of 276 hp, and was an incredibly rapid car, making it the perfect cheaper alternative for the incredibly expensive 4th gen model.

        992 Mazda Efini RX-7 Type-R</h2>
      <p>
        Despite a rocky start in Japan due to not complying with Japanese dimension regulations, the third-generation Mazda RX-7 is arguably the best car they've ever built. Its brilliant design combines with a thrilling rotary engine to make the perfect sports car, and a thrilling one to drive, too.

        With an updated body and a sequential twin-turbo rotary engine pushing out 252 hp at launch, the Series 6 RX-7 was both gorgeous and fast. The Type-R was a lightweight sports model, including some weight shaving with thinner glass, reduced sound insulation, and lightweight components in various areas, including the rear spoiler and seats. Any RX-7 is a thrill, but if you're looking for a more classic model, the early 90s Type-R is the perfect solution.

      <h2> <span>2</span>
        1998 Nissan Fairlady Z Version R</h2>
      <p>
        The 1998 Nissan Fairlady Z Version R may be a couple of years younger than most others on this list, but there is still no doubting its status as a classic icon of the 90s JDM scene. The Version R was the perfect race-tuned package, and was only available in Japan, unlike most other Fairlady Z/300ZX trims.

The Version R was powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine known as the VG30DETT and produced around 280 hp and 283 lb-ft of torque. As well as other modifications, the R received performance-oriented suspension upgrades, including stiffer springs, revised shock absorbers, and thicker anti-roll bars. These enhancements improved the car's handling and responsiveness, making it more capable on both the street and the track. Combined with a cool-looking body kit, the R still is an exciting JDM car no matter your preferences, and still has enough power to blow you away.

      <h2> <span>1</span>
        1994 Toyota Celica GT-Four</h2>
      <p>
        The Toyota Celica GT-Four rolled out of the factory as a road-going version of their Group A WRC monster. Driven by the likes of Carlos Sainz Sr, the car was an instant success. By the time the third generation rolled around, the GT-Four was both a successful race car and a favorite in the JDM community.

Hence the name, the GT-Four featured an all-wheel drive system, and when combined with the 3S-GTE producing 239 hp, the Four was an incredibly fast JDM car for its time. For one reason or another, the GT-Four never seems to quite get the same amount of praise as some of its rivals. This is a shame really, as on a pure driving experience level, not many 90s JDM cars can beat it.
