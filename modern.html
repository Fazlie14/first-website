        <h2><span>10</span>
          Subaru WRX</h2>
        <p>If you are a sucker for something unique, the Subie's iconic rumble is entertaining and confidence-inspiring. If you are in it for the power, the WRX STI is well capable of taking some heavy tuning and making serious power. <br>
          There is a massive cult-like following behind the WRX platform, which means it'll be easy for new tuners to make the best out of their Subaru. While these cars hold their value very well, they are relatively affordable and easy to modify.

        <h2><span>9</span>
          Mitsubishi Lancer Evo</h2>
        <p>The Evo Lancer is a legendary racing sedan that has challenged and dominated multiple times in its category. While its arch-rival, the Subaru WRX, is a superb outfit in the sports sedan category, you get sharper driving from the Evo. Newer Evos even have improved steering and suspension compared to previous generations. <br>
          The powertrain is responsive and ready for tuning to turn the already fast car into an understated sleeper. The competition between Evo and WRX is rampant, from the manufacturers to the owners of both brands. This competition is what has made these cars better over the years. Once you get into the Evo, you'll find a brand loyal community and an aftermarket ready to support you throughout your build journey.

        <h2><span>8</span>
          Honda S2000</h2>
        <p>The Honda S2000 is another JDM icon that fanatics love dearly for its high-revving engine with a redline at 8,900 RPM. Although it has a beautiful, curvy body to look at, popping the hood will reveal the center of the show, that VTEC engine. <br>
          What the S2000 excels at is its ability to make great horsepower per liter, all while being naturally aspirated. Introducing compression mods such as a supercharger or turbocharger is enough to make serious power in the range of 500 hp. Considering that the S2000 already has world-class handling and transmission, you could easily bring this dirt-cheap performance car to slay supercars.

        <h2><span>7</span>
          Second Generation Subaru Forester</h2>
        <p>Fanatics of this car anywhere will tell you it's one of the best sleepers on this list. The XT version came with a turbocharger and a wide array of tuning options. A commonplace mod is swapping to an STI engine, although others will go for an overland build. Whichever style you are into, the all-wheel drive system by Subaru will suffice.<br>
          The XT Foresters had turbochargers earlier in the 2000s, but it wasn't until the 2006 model that they saw a more aggressive engine setup. If you are eager to start wrenching on one of these, you'll be glad to learn that they are relatively inexpensive and hold their value very well.

        <h2><span>6</span>
          Nissan Patrol</h2>
        <p>While the Forester can be modded to be an overland beast, serious off-roaders will tell you that the Nissan Patrol is one of the best off-roading SUVs apart from the Toyota Landcruiser. Some common mods include heavy-duty off-roading suspension, interior, and exterior lighting, roof racks, winch, tires, turbochargers, and superchargers for more power and torque.<br>
          These cars have a reputation for being extremely reliable while being subjected to heavy-duty tasks. You can find a 2000s Patrol for a reasonable price and instantly get yourself a foundation for a great build.

      <div>
        <h2><span>5</span>
          Toyota 86/ Subaru BRZ</h2>
        <p>These two modern sportscars are all the same, save for tuning and trim differences. They are solid cars mechanically with fantastic handling, great aftermarket support, and parts availability. While the car has a great, sporty design, it might be underpowered. The naturally aspirated engine makes around 200 hp but can feel sluggish at low speeds.<br>
          Future redesigns of the Toyota86/Subaru BRZ will likely have a turbo option, which could solve the acceleration issue. But even then, serious gear heads who appreciate the value of this car are already known to add their turbochargers. The stock platform can be pushed to make over 300 hp without reliability issues.

        <h2><span>4</span>
          Nissan 350Z</h2>
        <p>The Z line of Nissans found favor among many gearheads for a good reason. These stunningly styled coupes are not only affordable, but they are capable of making insane power. Although the newer 370Z is more powerful, fanatics are still loyal to the 350Z. Furthermore, only minor changes in the chassis and a small power bump set the two aside.<br>
          When 350Zs first came out, their 3.5L V6s were good for 287-300 hp, making them an instant hit. By its final years of production, the engine upgrades were capable of over 306 hp. These engines can be tuned to 360 hp cheaply and reliably, making this car a proper beast.

      <div>
        <h2><span>3</span>
          Acura RSX</h2>
        <p>Honda's DC5 Integra is a legendary nameplate in Japan that represents one of the best handling front wheel drives ever, and the Acura RSX is its American version. The 2003 and 2004 models were renowned for precise handling and smooth transmission. With a little shopping, you could find the magical Type-S, which featured bigger ventilated brakes, larger sway bars, and sport-tuned suspension. <br>
          Although it made 160 hp from the factory, one can squeeze as high as 400 hp from the K20A3 engine pretty reliably. Since these are relatively inexpensive cars, the RSX gives you a solid option for under $10,000.

      <div>
        <h2><span>2</span>
          Toyota GR Yaris</h2>
        <p>The GR Yaris perfectly embodies the phrase "there is a replacement for displacement." Thanks to modern technology in turbocharging, the Yaris proves that you don't need humongous V8s and V12s to generate decent power. While automakers such as Mercedes have already proven that an engine block as small as four cylinders is capable of making over 400hp, it's Toyota's three-cylinder Yaris pushes this narrative to the limit. <br>
          The Yaris is not your ordinary hatchback. Instead, you are looking at a proper hot hatch resulting from Toyota's experience in rally circuits. When new, its 1.6-liter engine is capable of 270 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque, but tuners on this platform have easily achieved over 450hp.

        <h2><span>1</span>
          Mazda RX-8</h2>
        <p>A standard-looking Mazda RX-8 has beautiful curves to turn necks wherever you go. However, the market offers plenty of body parts, such as a wide body kit that would instantly turn an RX-8 into a beast. <br>
          While the car's engine might have had a history of unreliability and inefficiency, it still has stunning looks and superb handling. These issues have since found solutions, and the delightful little 1.3-liter rotary engine is capable of 231 Hp. Even stock, it can always outrun many sedans or sports cars. Now, enthusiasts can build any performance beast using the RX-8 as the basis.
